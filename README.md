# Gates-Mydlarz-bleaching-recovery
This project examines the response of coral physiology and immunity to repeated bleaching and subsequent recovery during the 2014 - 2016 global bleaching events in Hawai'i. The coral Montipira capitata was collected from two reef locations within Kāne'ohe Bay, O'ahu, Hawai'i: Lilipuna Reef and Reef 14 in southern and central Kāne'ohe Bay, respectively.
